merchant.py is a daemon that manages payments for a web server. It
creates Ixcoin addresses using a master public key (so you do not
leave your private keys on the server), detects when payments are
received and notifies your web application.

The workflow goes like this:

 - the server sends a request to the daemon via POST. the request
   contains an amount to be paid, a number of confirmations, and an
   expiration period in hours.

 - the daemon answers with a Ixcoin address, where the customer needs
   to send the coins.

 - later, the daemon will send a POST to the webserver, to notify that
   the payment has been received OR that the request has expired


Since addresses are generated using an Electrum-IXC master public key, it
is possible to visualize payments in the Electrum-IXC client; you will,
however, need to manually adjust your "gap limit". 

In order to use this script, first edit and rename
merchant.conf.template to merchant.conf

to launch it, type:
> python merchant.py

In another terminal, you may send a request from the command line (it
will send the request to the running daemon via http). For example,
here is a request for 0.1 ixcoins, that requires two confirmations,
and expires in 120 minutes:

> python merchant.py request 0.1 2 120
