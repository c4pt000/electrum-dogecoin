Getting started
===============

(*If you've come here looking to simply run Electrum-NMC,* `you may download it here`_.)

.. _you may download it here: https://www.namecoin.org/download/betas/

Electrum-NMC itself is pure Python, and so are most of the required dependencies,
but not everything. The following sections describe how to run from source, but here
is a TL;DR::

    sudo apt-get install libsecp256k1-0
    python3 -m pip install --user .[gui,crypto]


Not pure-python dependencies
----------------------------

If you want to use the Qt interface, install the Qt dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

For elliptic curve operations, `libsecp256k1`_ is a required dependency::

    sudo apt-get install libsecp256k1-0

Alternatively, when running from a cloned repository, a script is provided to build
libsecp256k1 yourself::

    sudo apt-get install automake libtool
    ./contrib/make_libsecp256k1.sh

Due to the need for fast symmetric ciphers, `cryptography`_ is required.
Install from your package manager (or from pip)::

    sudo apt-get install python3-cryptography


If you would like hardware wallet support, see `this`_.

.. _pycryptodomex: https://github.com/Legrandin/pycryptodome
.. _cryptography: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography

Running from tar.gz
-------------------

If you downloaded the official package (tar.gz), you can run
Electrum-NMC from its root directory without installing it on your
system; all the pure python dependencies are included in the 'packages'
directory. To run Electrum-NMC from its root directory, just do::

    ./run_electrum_nmc

You can also install Electrum-NMC on your system, by running this command::

    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-pip
    python3 -m pip install --user .

This will download and install the Python dependencies used by
Electrum-NMC instead of using the 'packages' directory.
It will also place an executable named :code:`electrum-nmc` in :code:`~/.local/bin`,
so make sure that is on your :code:`PATH` variable.


Development version (git clone)
-------------------------------

Check out the code from GitHub::

    git clone git://github.com/namecoin/electrum-nmc.git
    cd electrum-nmc
    git submodule update --init

Run install (this should install dependencies)::

    python3 -m pip install --user -e .


Compile the Qt UI::

    sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
    ./contrib/make_qt_forms

Copy over the www root::

    rm -rf electrum_nmc/electrum/www
    cp -a electrum/www electrum_nmc/electrum/www

Create translations (optional)::

    sudo apt-get install python-requests gettext
    ./contrib/pull_locale

Finally, to start Electrum::

    ./run_electrum_nmc

AuxPoW Branch
=============

Electrum-NMC also maintains an ``auxpow`` branch.  This branch is identical to the upstream Bitcoin version of Electrum (e.g. it doesn't have any name support or Namecoin rebranding), except that it supports AuxPoW (merged mining).  It may be useful as a starting point for porting Electrum to other AuxPoW-based cryptocurrencies.
